# 👁️ Face Detection using OpenCV

This project is a **real-time face and eye detection system** built using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
It uses the **Haar Cascade Classifier** — a machine learning-based approach for detecting faces and eyes through a webcam or image.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This project detects faces and eyes using your system's webcam and draws rectangles around them in real-time.  
It demonstrates the core concept of **computer vision** and **image processing** using OpenCV’s built-in classifiers.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧍 Real-time **face detection** using webcam  
- 👀 **Eye detection** within detected face regions  
- 💾 Works with both **images** and **video streams**  
- ⚙️ Adjustable parameters for accuracy (e.g., `scaleFactor`, `minNeighbors`)  
- 🧱 Simple, beginner-friendly implementation in Python  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.12**
- **OpenCV (cv2)**
